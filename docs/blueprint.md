- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4F8), close in hue to the primary, for a calm, clean background.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#DFA365), placed 30 degrees away on the color wheel. To provide clear visual cues and a contrast, it is designed to draw users' attention to critical actions or information within the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font offering a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use consistent, line-based icons throughout the app to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic. Ensure icons are easily recognizable and related to their corresponding actions or content.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize information clearly. Cards should be well-spaced and visually distinct to enhance readability.
